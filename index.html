            <span class="blogContent">I'm so happy that I actually launched it!!! It honestly feels like a dream because of all the positive feedback I've recieved. Naturally, I'm using my product on my son. I need my heir to grow up strong after all. It's not all roses though. There do seem to be some people that are immune to facts and logic. I was just minding my own business at Walmart, explaining to a child that they shouldn't take vaccines, but then... <i>Read More</i></span>

            <span class="blogSubtitle">by <i>Tyler Bradford</i> | 21 October, 2019</span>
            <span class="blogContent">Honestly I am so upset right now, so please bear with me if this post is all over the place. At our routine checkup, my son was diagnosed with chickenpox. At first, I wasn't sure if the doctor was lying to me or not, but when I got home, I went onto some blogs and found that he exactly matched the symptoms. Where did I go wrong?? I think he might have gotten it from the vaccines that he took before I knew about the danger. I am in tears right now, but I know that I have to stay strong for all of the people... <i>Read More</i></span>

            <span class="blogContent">People say that there are five stages of grief... I feel like I'm a mix of denial and acceptance right now. Tylette was always a wonderful ball of sunshine in my life, and if my wife didn't ghost me, I'm sure she would miss him too. This sucks almost too much to be true, but I think I can use this grief to improve my product. Every so often, I wonder if I made the right choice in unvaccinating him, but whenever I look at his ashes (self cremated so that the government can't experiment with his body) I know that it's what he would have wanted. Society may be against us, but like Socrates and his heliocentric theory, we must stand strong for what we know is true. We must never vaccinate, or... <i>Read More</i></span>
